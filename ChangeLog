Revision history for Perl module Text::Unidecode

2014-06-23   Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* !DEVELOPER RELEASE!
	* Release 1.00_03
	* Now asserting that we need at least Perl 5.8.0
	An automated test system that tried running the t/*.t
        under a 5.6.2 spewed all kinds of crazy error messages.
	Hence the bump-up.
	So, I added assertions for the version.
	* I added some tests for more basic sanity assertions.

2014-06-17   Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	v1.00_02 - Not released.  Just internal rearranging.

	
2014-06-13   Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* !DEVELOPER RELEASE!
	* Release 1.00(_01!)- so many years later, finally we bump up to 1.*!

	* My documentation is now BRILLIANT.
	* Minor bugfixes.
	* Some code comments for clarity.
	* A modern test suite.

	* A proper release will follow in a few days.
	
	
2001-07-14  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
